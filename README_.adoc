= Automated UI Test using Selenium backed by Docker Container


== Problem to solve

I am interested in automating Web UI testing in Java/Groovy using Selenium WebDriver. At the same time, I am interested in developing Web Server applications in Python. So I want to execute UI tests written in Java against my Web Application written in Python. Of course, I can do it by the following manual operations.

In a Terminal on Mac, I start a Docker container by

----
$ cd ~/tmp
$ docker run -d -p 80:8080 kazurayam/flaskr-kazurayam:1.1.0
----

I will open another Terminal, and execute UI tests by

----
$ cd $projectDir
$ gradle test
....
----

When the test has finished, I will go back to the 1st terminal window. I will identify the process id of the docker container:

----
$ docker ps --filter publish=80 --filter status=running -q
fd5ad3b76b13
----

Once I find the pid, I can stop the process gracefully by:

----
$ docker stop fd5ad3b76b13
----

This procedure is not difficult. But it is cumbersome, easy to make mistakes. I often forget terminating the previous docker container, and try to start another one. Then I get an error saying "the IP port is already in use". Just frustrating.

So, I want to automate starting and stopping any Docker Container on the localhost by my test code in Java.


== Solution

I have developed a code in Java using JUnit 5, which does the following:

* This test visits and tests a URL "http://127.0.0.1:3080/" using Selenium WebDriver.

* The URL is served by a process on the localhost, in which a Docker Container runs using a docker image which kazurayam published.

* The web app was originally developed in Python language by the Pallets project, is published at link:https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/[flaskr tutorial]

* This test automates running and stopping a Docker Container process using commandline commands: `docker run`, `docker ps` and `docker stop`.

* The https://github.com/kazurayam/subprocessj/blob/master/src/main/java/com/kazurayam/subprocessj/docker/ContainerRunner.java[`com.kazurayam.subprocessj.docker.ContainerRunner`] class wraps the "docker run" command.

* The https://github.com/kazurayam/subprocessj/blob/master/src/main/java/com/kazurayam/subprocessj/docker/ContainerFinder.java[`com.kazurayam.subprocessj.docker.ContainerFinder`] class wraps the "docker ps" command.

* The https://github.com/kazurayam/subprocessj/blob/master/src/main/java/com/kazurayam/subprocessj/docker/ContainerStopper.java[`com.kazurayam.subprocessj.docker.ContainerStopper`] class wraps the "docker stop" command.

* These classes call https://www.baeldung.com/java-lang-processbuilder-api[`java.lang.ProcessBuilder`] to execute the `docker` command from Java.

* The https://github.com/kazurayam/subprocessj/blob/master/src/main/java/com/kazurayam/subprocessj/Subprocess.java[`com.kazurayam.subprocessj.Subprocess`] class wraps the `ProcessBuilder` and provides a simple API for Java application with work with OS commands.

== Conclusion

I wanted to perform automated Web UI testings written in Java/Groovy against a web application written in Python. The https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.kazurayam/subprocessj[Subprocessj 0.3.0] library made it possible for me. I am contented with it.
